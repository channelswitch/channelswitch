channelswitch

This is a C program generating Verilog for an arbitrarily reconfigurable
switch/interleaver based on a reconfigurably nonblocking Clos network (other
alternatives exist but are not recommended). The number of parallel inputs and
the period in which to reorder things are parameters, as well as the datatype
of samples in bits. Compile it and run with --help for more info.
