This is a C program generating Verilog for an arbitrarily reconfigurable
switch/interleaver based on a rearrangingly nonblocking Clos network (other
alternatives exist but are not recommended). The number of parallel inputs and
the period in which to reorder things are parameters, as well as the datatype
of samples in bits. Compile it and run with --help for more info.

If you use this for anything interesting please email me at rolst191@gmail.com.

The archive report.zip contains Latex source for the report and the file
route.ipe is an IPE file with a slideshow showing how Clos network rearranging
works. You would have to figure out how to build the report yourself because
some stuff is missing.
